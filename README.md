# BTC-LSTM-NSGA2
A Python project for forecasting Bitcoin (BTC) price using an LSTM network. It employs the NSGA-II genetic algorithm for multi-objective hyperparameter optimization, balancing prediction error (validation loss) against model complexity (parameter count). The result is a Pareto front of optimal models. Tech: TensorFlow, DEAP.
